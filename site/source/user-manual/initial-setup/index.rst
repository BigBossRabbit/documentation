Getting Started - Initial Setup
===============================

A self-hosting experience with StartOS begins with setting up your server for the first time or by wiping an existing server to completely start over. For both of these options, choose `Start Fresh`. To transfer existing server data to a new machine or a new disk, or to perform a disaster recovery from backups, choose `Recovery Options`.
